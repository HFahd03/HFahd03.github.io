I’m 21 years old and currently studying computer science. I’m originally from Morocco but currently in the U.S., where I also work with an airline. I’m passionate about technology and always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in both my studies and career!</p> <p>My academic background includes...</p> <p>I'm interested in cybersecurity because I enjoy problem-solving and protecting digital systems from threats. With the rise of cyber attacks, I find it fascinating to learn how to secure networks, identify vulnerabilities, and stay ahead of hackers.</p> </section> <section id="skills"> <h2>Skills</h2> <ul> <li> Networking & Security Fundamentals</li> <li>Programming & Scripting</li> <li>Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking</li> <li>Web Application Security</li> <li>Cryptography</li> <li>Cloud Security</li> </ul> </section> <section id="field"> <h2>My Field: Cyber Security</h2> <p>One of the biggest trends in cybersecurity today is the Zero Trust Security model. Traditionally, security frameworks operated under the assumption that everything inside a network could be trusted. However, with the rise of sophisticated cyber threats, remote work, and cloud computing, this approach is no longer effective.</p> <p>Zero Trust Security is a modern cybersecurity approach that eliminates implicit trust and requires continuous verification of all users, devices, and applications. It helps protect against insider threats, reduces data breach risks, and strengthens security for remote work and cloud environments. By enforcing strict authentication, least privilege access, and network segmentation, Zero Trust limits cyber threats and prevents attackers from moving freely within a system. It also supports compliance with regulations like GDPR and NIST, making it a critical strategy for organizations looking to enhance their security posture.</p> <p>I’m interested in cybersecurity because it’s an ever-evolving field that challenges me to stay ahead of new threats and continuously learn. The idea of protecting systems, networks, and data from malicious actors is both exciting and rewarding. Cybersecurity offers a blend of problem-solving, technical skills, and strategic thinking, all of which align with my passion for technology. </p> </section> <section id="contact"> <h2>Contact Me</h2> <p>Email: Fahdhamour03@gmail.com</p> <p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahd-hamour/</p> </section> <footer> <p>© 2025 Fahd Hamour</p> </footer> </body> </html>
