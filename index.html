I’m 21 years old and currently studying computer science. I’m originally from Morocco but currently in the U.S., where I also work with an airline. I’m passionate about technology and always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in both my studies and career!</p> <p>My academic background includes a strong foundation in computer science, where I've gained expertise in areas such as programming, algorithms, data structures, and networking. I am currently pursuing my degree, deepening my knowledge in subjects like cybersecurity and software development, with a focus on real-world problem-solving and technical skills. My studies have equipped me with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, preparing me for a career in the tech industry.</p> <p>I'm interested in cybersecurity because I enjoy problem-solving and protecting digital systems from threats. With the rise of cyber attacks, I find it fascinating to learn how to secure networks, identify vulnerabilities, and stay ahead of hackers.</p> </section> <section id="skills"> <h2>Skills</h2> <ul> <li> Networking & Security Fundamentals</li> <li>Programming & Scripting</li> <li>Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking</li> <li>Adaptability & Continuous Learning</li> <li>Cryptography</li> <li>Communication Skills</li> </ul> </section> <section id="field"> <h2>My Field: Cyber Security</h2> <p>One of the biggest trends in cybersecurity today is the Zero Trust Security model. Traditionally, security frameworks operated under the assumption that everything inside a network could be trusted. However, with the rise of sophisticated cyber threats, remote work, and cloud computing, this approach is no longer effective.</p> <p>Zero Trust is crucial for organizations because it addresses the increasing complexity of modern IT environments. With the rise of cloud computing, remote work, and sophisticated cyberattacks, traditional perimeter security models are no longer sufficient. Zero Trust provides a layered defense system that protects against insider threats, reduces the impact of breaches, and ensures that only authorized users have access to critical resources. By continuously verifying identities, securing endpoints, and minimizing access to sensitive data, organizations can significantly improve their security posture.</p> <p>I’m interested in cybersecurity because it’s an ever-evolving field that challenges me to stay ahead of new threats and continuously learn. The idea of protecting systems, networks, and data from malicious actors is both exciting and rewarding. Cybersecurity offers a blend of problem-solving, technical skills, and strategic thinking, all of which align with my passion for technology. </p> </section> <section id="contact"> <h2>Contact Me</h2> <p>Email: Fahdhamour03@gmail.com</p> <p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahd-hamour/</p> </section> <footer> <p>© 2025 Fahd Hamour</p> </footer> </body> </html>
